This project in conjunction with cismet/sudplan-wupp-model-ie and cismet/geocpm-rest forms the Wuppertal Pilot integration done in the SUDPLAN project. It allows to:
* Import whole GeoCPM (and DYNA) configurations
* Do urban planning with respect to optimised storm water runoff
* Execute planning scenarios with rainevents generated from historic or future (downscaled) rain data
* Examine results in 2D, 3D and 4D

The implementation is based on the cismet/cids-custom-sudplan-3d project.
